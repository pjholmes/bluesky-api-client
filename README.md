# Really simple calls to Bluesky API

Steps

1. npm install
   
2. Change the code in index.ts to login with your own identifier

3. Un-comment other calls as desired
   
4. export BLUESKY_PASSWORD="mySecretPassword"

5. run `npx tsc`

> Note: (I got 3 errors messages but still get expected results at runtime)

6. run `node ./dist/index.js`
